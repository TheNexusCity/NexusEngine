          session cookies and persistent cookies. We may also collect information about you from your device such as
          device type, machine or mobile device identification number and unique advertising identifiers. Below is a
          general primer on session and persistent cookies; information collected by cookies depends on its particular
          purpose. For more information, please see the information regarding analytics providers discussed further
          below.
